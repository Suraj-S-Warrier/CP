your trysts with data types are going a little too far,brother. you are
making a hell lot of wrong submissions, and a majority of them are because of 
the wrong data types you use...and its not even like you make some 
cool error like used map instead of priority queue..its the lame ass int
instead of long long EVERY SINGLE TIME! correct yourself before you make anymore
wrong submissions.
