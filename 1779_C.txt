Hello 2023 C. Least Prefix Sum

The solution is pretty good and stuff...Take 2 priority queues, one for after m, and one for before. The after one should be increasing.
First of all, store prefix sums in an array. Then loop for elements after m. in the loop, keep adding elements in the pq, and keep checking 
whether pre[i]<pre[m]. if yes, then do -2*pq.top() to pre[i]. keep doing it until the condition is false. increase op until then too.

Similarly for the part before m. 

The problem here is, even though im able to get AC, when i looked at the submission which i made some time ago, logically they seemed to be same.
But it somehow is indeed different and hence i was getting wrong submission. The takeaway here is, even though the logic is same, 
i wasnt able to get AC that day. But i got AC today for the same logic. it just differed probably on how it handled one of the edges conditions.
So, if stuck in a problem, and the logic that you made seems foolproof AND you have extra time to spare after doing all the questions that
you possibly can do, come back to the question and code it again completely from scratch and if the code has multiple subparts, try mixing up
 the order too. It just might work.
