The question is of a lesser difficulty than usual...but it was so that you could get out
of your slump by tonight. Could use binary search on top of this to make it 
even more efficient.

YEs, as expected, the tutorial has a binary search solution. But since 
i used the prefix array thing, i was able to reduce the complexity. Need to 
kinda practice more questions with binary search...so might mark this question
for future reference
