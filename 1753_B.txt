Codeforces Round 829 (Div. 1) B. Factorial Divisibility

It really did teach me something..if you feel it cannot be done in the time using the logic, there might a wawy to calculate it in 
less time, yes. But, there is also the other possibility that, that particular calculation is not needed at all. in this case, 
the calculation wasnt needed because, the maximum value it can take after the operations was less that x!, so if after operations,
we dont have any <x parts, then it is divisible. as simple as that. Also, this time on, i started looking at time taken for q and for code,
and i must say, there is a lot to improve. Need to start writing better code.
