INF:

got the logic and implemented..got ac in first attempt..congratulations!! but the problem is, your negligance cost you here too..didnt take into the factor that it was 1 indexed 
and not 0 indexed..had to refactor the code again..luckily(or coz of skill) you corrected but the even part and odd part in the first try itself)...try not to be negligent about this stuff
and pay attention.
