you better start practicing writing code like crazy,because the kinda mistakes and 
inefficiencies that you are making are crazily careless. and every single time you 
are confident on top of that, that you have done everything correctly. I thought
 you were making mistakes only for really tricky questions( not the ones with tricky
 logic but with tricky code writing) but no, you are making mistakes in the simplest of questions.
 you better get your head right!
