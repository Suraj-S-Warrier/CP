INF:
you definitely need a pen and a paper for solving constructive algorihm qs...its not that you cant get the logic without it..but chances of there being a sneaky af exception is quite high
so be on the lookout..also..be more mondful and careful while coding..the only reason others are able to write code faster is because they have lesser errors in code than you..not typing speed
so try to make less mistakes and read the question constraints, and test cases very carefully.
