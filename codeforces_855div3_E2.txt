the solution which i found for the question just seemed so easy...but then had to submit
thrice to get AC. but it wasnt becasue the initial idea was wrong..but it was because 
the algorithm had an exception and i overlooked that. was a kind of an 
exception which could come under the category of lack of practice. now lemme 
check the tut solution coz in the tags it was given dfs anol but my solution 
didnt have any of those.

Ok, so the tut solution indeed has dfs in it...but the problem is i dont understand
it properly..prolly have to look it u up in youtube later..
