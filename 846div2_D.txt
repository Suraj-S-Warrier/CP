INF:

cout.setf(ios::fixed);
cout << setprecision(0) << value<<endl;

Remember these lines when you want an output in integers and not scientific notation...use it in each cout statement involving suspicious integers...ios::fixed keeps the number in float
while the setprecision(0) removes all the decimal parts..you can manipulate that 0 to give decimal precision of your choice. Other than that...D was pretty much a straight forward q i guess
