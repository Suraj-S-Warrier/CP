INF:

This was such an awesome q..leanr quite a lot even though i wasnt able to code it without looking at the solution.
Also, this didnt use any new trick at all. it was simply an implementation question. we just needed to know how to use a 
set properly. We had to make use of the fact that the element will not be used more than 3 times..so whenever it is active, keep its index in the set, otherwise delete 
it.. we also learnt how to use the lower_bound() function of sets..also learnt about the erase function and that for set, if we are 
iterating through it, we usually avoid deletions coz it might make the loop go crazy coz of fucked up indexing..
but that can be corrected with sets..we just need to assign the return value of the erase function back to the iterator.Quite sad that 
it was an awesome data structures question and you messed up. Sed.
