Educational Codeforces Round 144 (Rated for Div. 2) C. Maximum Set

The logic was simpe enough..it was the optimising to bring it down below O(n) which took time..shouldve seen that it was 
supposed to be less than O(n)..lost a submission there...lost another submission because i left in a O(n) loop in the main code 
which wasnt doing anything other than increase the time taken..was a loop which i had used in the previous submission..lost another 
submission in that..wouldve been devastating in a real contest.

Hmmm...so the real solution had O(1) solution and i had logn solution...the thing is, i really didnt need to use binary search to find 
those partitions..its just simple arithmatics. Pretty disappointing.
