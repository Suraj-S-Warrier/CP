Codeforces Round 871 (Div. 4) G. Hits Different

The problem tags seems to be saying 'data structures' but i didnt use any awesome ones...so im guessing there is an awesome way of 
doing this question rather than just brute force finding the row, and keeping 2 pointers to specify the range of cans about to be toppled,
and finding squares and adding them all together.i mean..i didnt even use the optimisation of adding the initial contiguous cans 
using formula..i simply looped and added. Still AC.

Yup, as suspected, there was a O(n) solution whereas mine was around o(n^2) or something weird like that..
We need to visualise the cans differently and then we will get a 2D array and then getting the prefix sum, we get the answer for every single
test case in o(1). cool, huh?
