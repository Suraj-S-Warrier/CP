INF:

the logic is sooo guud..as you said, you cannot multiply everything..for qs like thid,
the first idea should indeed be turning it into a prefix sum kinda thing..
but the next might indeed be to thing backwards..instead of the multiply part..think about the additing part..think of all possibilities..
finding factors is just O(sqrt(n))..check whether we have that factor in the array. Simple. Beautiful. Elagant.
