INF:

Didnt complete the question..got an uncommon error...memory limit exceeded..now, by my understanding through
basic googling, we can store arrays of max size 10^7 and when we try to do 10^8 we will get memory limit exceeded error..
that is, if it is an int. Summary: max memory size is around 2^28 bytes..when an ints are stored in an array, each takes up 4 bytes..for ll it is 8 bytes..

Update:

So, i changed data type from ll to int so that it makes a difference..it didnt. Then i had to change the data type of container from 
vector to array..dunno if that helped coz i also declared the container globally..and it got AC so i dont know what did the trick..changing from vector to array
or making it global.
The solution was also along the same lines, so im guessing there indeed wasnt any greedy solution
