Codeforces Round 826 (Div. 3) E. Sending a Sequence Over the Network

wheewwww!...evidently, u need a lot of work on dp co this was simply torture...u saw the tutorial...and still took 6 submissions and 3 days
to find how to implement dp and that too PROPERLY, in the code. That kind of problem could be a killer in the interview and you shouldnt
be taking any chances and doing every dp question that lands in front of you.
