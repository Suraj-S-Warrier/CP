Codeforces Round 833 (Div. 2) C. Zero-Sum Prefixes

still gotta decrease the time required for coding and debugging..took kinda like 15 mins for 44 lines of code. Be in the present to 
decrease bugs due to carelessness. Logical bugs can still be tolerated since we are actively trying to improve our thought processes..
but careless bugs are sources of huge time lags, since we are making mistakes in places where we dont make them normally..hence we wont
think to check those places either. Logical bugs are less problematic right now since, there will be a larger proportion of 
people who will be making the same mistakes.
