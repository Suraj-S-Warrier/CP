INF:

One of the first questions in a long time...and that too, in a contest..where i actually got 
the logic which fit the time complexity but didnt know how to code it up...sed..had to look up in internet on how to 
generate all combinations of k indices in n natural numbers...gotta understand that logic and make sure you
never forget it coz it looks pretty basic and useful..and as for the logic i found, the code hit about 120 lines..
so im guessing this isnt the right logic which the setters meant..also had to use a lot of really complex data structures..
not that im complaining about it..kinda enjoyed using such a lot in the same queestion..but still surprised that
i was ablwe to pull it off..really undermining myself all this time.

Now, leeme check the tutorial and setter's code and stuff.

Ok, so checked and apparently that is indeed the solution..there is no greedy method or anything....grt.
