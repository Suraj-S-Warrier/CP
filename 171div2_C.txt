INF:

Twas an awesome q!!!!..loved it! Made me think for the logic
for a long long time..but you shouldnt be thinking for the logic for such a long
time anyways i guess..your logic was..since you had to find ladders..the only case where the 
interval is not a ladder is, when an inc in slope occurs after a decrease in slope within the
interval..this can further be formalised as, the first inc in slope before r( looking backwards) 
should occur before the first decrease in slope after l...and here inc in slope just means ppositive slope 
and decrease in slope meeans neg slope.Neat solution, huh? pretty proud of meself.

the solution said pretty much the same as yours..also there is this function called iota 
which gives all the paositions of an array between the given range, a sequence of increasing values starting with val
followed by val +1, val +2, etc..
