Codeforces Round 843 (Div. 2) C. Interesting Sequence

It was a question involving a lot of bitmasks..its a good practice since u are a little weak in this concept. Had to find the pattern
where it works and where it doesnt. The major takeaway from this question is, even if your logic is correct in bitmask questions,
and it "seems" like you have written the code right, it might give you errors..because bitwise operator precedences and its interaction
with the other operators are messed up..so it is advisable to always use parantheses always in questions involving manipulating the 
bits.
