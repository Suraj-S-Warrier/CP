INF:

Half expected sich an old question to be idiotic..but it was quite good...had a good implementation 
and also a nice visually appealing logic( mine)..now lemme check out the soln and tutorial

ok so checked the tutorial...there werent any..there were solutions only for D and E and not for the rest..
But the tag was indeed mentioned 'graph'..so im guessing there could be an adjacency list logic which didnt require map of pair to pair..
or any such complex data structures..
