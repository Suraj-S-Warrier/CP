SWERC_2022_23_L

got into 3/4rths of the layers..but couldnt crack the rest because of sloppiness..
as im returning, i notice that im less focused than i used to be..need to 
get back to the previous glory. here, in this question, i calculated the 
range of the final answer to be different..that made a lot of difference..
need to avoid such carelessness...also, i wrote a bit of redundant recurring code
for no reason because of false assumptions which couldve been removed if only
i had thought about it a bit...if Cy/(x-y) is an integer where C is an integer, then Cx/(y-x)
will also be an integer since their sum is an integer.
