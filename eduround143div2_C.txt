was a really good question..kinda sad that you needed to take a little peek and a loooott of time to figure it out..the peek revealed a 
technique i learnt quite some time ago and had forgotten..the method of difference arrays....basically, if you have to increase
the value of a range of elements in an array and you have to do it multiple times, instead of the naive n^2 method, you can simply
create a new array called D,initialised to D[i] =A[i]-A[i-1]. in each query, increase the value at the start index of the update in the D array by the 
update value...ie, if you need to increase the values of the elements from i to j by k, then D[i] += k. Also, D[j+1]-=k.Keep doing these
updations for each query and in the end, run a loop of n, with D[i] = D[i]+ D[i-1] to get the updated array. Just that simple and the
work is done in just O(n). Dont forget this. Difference array or delta encoding. it is called by both names. Other than that, theq just had 
taking prefix sums from behind, which you figured out..kudos for that...you found out because you properly dissected the question and
realised what information you didnt use yet. analyse questions procedurally like that you shall have no problem in finding solutions
for most questions. the solution given also aligned with your solution.
