Questions like these depends on the configurations you select on choosing 
the subarrays in an orderly manner...the order which was chosen was take
all the subarrays which start with a particular index..so if i select subarrays
like that, then the k subarrays can be set up in the beginning of the array
itself. its quite sad that this idea didnt strike you and had to be told to
you by someone else.
