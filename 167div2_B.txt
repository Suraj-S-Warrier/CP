INF:
You did good, but then this was an easy question..Questions like these remind us why we have to look at
tutorial and solutions even if we know the answer..because we dont know when we get a unique and 
thought-provoking answer.
Just remember,
next time when the relation is:
f(0) = 0
f(2x) = f(x)
f(2x+1) = f(x) +1

it means that the function is directly related to the number of set bits in the
binary representation of the number

Also, there is a built in function to count number of set bits...__builtin_popcount(x)
