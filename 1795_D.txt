Educational Codeforces Round 143 (Rated for Div. 2) D. Triangle Coloring

Learnt quite a lot with this question..the logic is, divide the triplet sets into 2..one with majorly red vertices, and other with blue.
in every set, to get the maximum out of it, take the two edges with maximum value..thus you get a 
configuration. For every ccombination of configuration of every set , there is (n/3)C(n/6) ways of colouring (by choosing n/6 out of
n/3 as the Red major set). There can be multiple configuration for a single set only if, there aremultiple selections of sides such that the 
sum is equal to the max sum possible. There can be either 3,2 or 1 such configuration in every set. Multiply all of them. Let the number be x.
Thus the answer is x* (n/3)C(n/6).

The logic finding was easy enough. But the mod NUM part...
->if there is an ncr part in the formula, ew dont always have to take multiplicative inverse. if the number is small enough, we can use
the idea that, if b divides a, then  (a/b)%NUM = (a%(NUM*b))/b....but if b is large, i doubt if we can use this.
-> so if we cannot use the above, we simply can find the numberator%NUM. Then find modular multiplicative inverse for every
term in the denominator and multiply it with the numerator and take mod NUM. it will simply take nlogn time.
