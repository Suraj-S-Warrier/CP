wasnt able to reach  the logic..the initial few steps were right though..
you deduced that checking every such combination wasnt viable..so decided that
there needed to be added iteratively and took less than n^2...but you 
thought that had something to do with the arrays..you needed to look a 
level deeper and realise that total number of occurrences of each value needed
to be monitored and manipulated.
