INF:

you got the logic to the major part...but still struggled because
there was a great idea in the implementation hidden too!!!
in the name of binary powers method. ok. so,if you are finding the value of something of the form
a^n..and you also have that modulo, lets say m, ka funda..then if the time is restricted that you cant find the powers all the way till
n..then you can make it log(n)..make a recursive function:

f1(n,m)
{
	if(n==0): return 1
	if(n%2==0): p = f1(n/2,m)%m; return (p*p)m
	if(n%2!=0): p=f1(n/2,m)%m; return ((p*p)%m *(a%m))%m;
